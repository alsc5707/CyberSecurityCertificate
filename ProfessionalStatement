My name is Alex. I have strong programming skills, strong written and verbal communication, and strong collaboration skills. I value protecting consumer data and creating a positive impact in the world. I am most interested in the ethical hacking and penetration testing aspect of cyber security and I hope that by being a hardworking collaborative and communication driven person, I can benefit the world through the protection and monitoring of data.
